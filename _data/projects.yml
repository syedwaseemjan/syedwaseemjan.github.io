  link: null
  details: I co-founded Chef Galaxy, a social marketplace for dishes and culinary services like matching Patrons with Chefs for their events. It used Python and Flask on the backend and vanilla Javascript with Bootstrap on the Frontend. It was deployed on AWS using EC2, S3, VPC, Elasticache and Opensearch. Chef Galaxy couldn't get successful but it gave me a lot to learn.

Applied <a href="https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern" target="_blank">7-1 Sass Architecture</a>, <a href="http://getbem.com/introduction/" target="_blank">CSS BEM methodogy</a> and used CSS3 flexbox, grid and some cool animations.
