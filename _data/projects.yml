- title: Chef Galaxy
  link: null
  details: I co-founded Chef Galaxy, a social marketplace aimed at connecting Patrons with Chefs to curate memorable culinary experiences for events like birthdays, weddings, and other gatherings. The platform featured a robust backend built with Python and Flask, handling the intricacies of matching Patrons with Chefs, while the frontend used vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap to create a seamless user experience. Chef Galaxy was deployed on AWS, leveraging EC2 for scalable compute power, S3 for storage, VPC for network management, Elasticache for caching, and Opensearch for efficient search functionality. Though Chef Galaxy ultimately didnâ€™t achieve long-term success, it was a valuable venture that deepened my understanding of full-stack development, cloud deployment, and the unique dynamics of the food-tech industry.

  link: https://www.artstor.org/
  details: I developed highly interactive graphical interfaces for ARTstor, a digital library boasting over one million images spanning the arts, architecture, humanities, and sciences. Utilizing ExtJS4 and JavaScript, I extensively customized ExtJS components to significantly enhance the user experience, ensuring that the interface was both intuitive and engaging. My work included providing robust cross-browser support, particularly for Internet Explorer, which presented unique challenges. Additionally, I leveraged advanced features of ExtJS to implement custom themes and facilitate internationalization, ensuring that the platform was accessible and user-friendly for a diverse audience of scholars, educators, and art enthusiasts. This project honed my skills in front-end development and deepened my understanding of creating tailored solutions for complex digital libraries.

  details: I designed and built this personal website without using any templates or frameworks using only vanilla CSS. Applied <a href="https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern" target="_blank">7-1 Sass Architecture</a>, <a href="http://getbem.com/introduction/" target="_blank">CSS BEM methodogy</a> and used CSS3 flexbox, grid and some cool animations. Additionally, I added dozens of media queries to provide support for <a href="https://github.com/syedwaseemjan/syedwaseemjan.github.io/blob/main/_sass/abstracts/_mixins.scss" target="_blank">different screen sizes</a>. My personal website also contains a link to my <a href="/blog" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.
