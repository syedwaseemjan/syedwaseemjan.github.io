At Tasq.io, I led a challenging yet rewarding initiative: transitioning several loosely connected repositories into a cohesive monolithic repository. This task, however, wasn’t just about merging code; it also involved addressing fundamental issues within each repo, from missing unit tests to inconsistent code quality. Through a structured migration process and the introduction of automated tools like Black, Ruff, and Sourcery, I transformed our development workflow into one that’s maintainable.


#### **Why Move to a Monolith?**

Managing multiple repositories can complicate code management leading to issues like:
   - **Code Duplication**: Shared logic is often duplicated across projects.
   - **Dependency Management**: Each repository requires separate dependency tracking.
   - **Deployment Inefficiencies**: CI/CD pipelines become challenging to maintain across repos.

Moving to a monolithic repo using [Polylith’s modular approach](https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith) presented a solution that allowed us to consolidate shared code, simplify dependency handling, and centralize deployment.


#### **The Initial Challenges**

The transition wasn’t without hurdles. The codebases lacked essential elements like:
1. **Unit Tests**: A lack of unit tests made it challenging to ensure that functionality remained intact during the migration.
2. **Code Quality**: Without standardized linting or formatting, code readability and maintainability were inconsistent.
3. **Code Duplication**: Shared functions and utilities were duplicated across repositories, making updates complex and error-prone.

These challenges meant that, in addition to migrating code, I had to improve code quality and enforce new standards across the monolith.


#### **Using Polylith’s Approach to Structure the Monolith**

The Polylith architectural style helped us structure the monolith in a way that balanced modularity with code reuse:
   - **Components**: Independent, reusable modules containing business logic.
   - **Bases**: Containers that allow components to interact and function as coherent applications.
   - **Projects**: Representing top-level applications, these projects leveraged shared components without redundant code.


#### **Building with Pants for Scalability**

Using [Pants build](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) enabled us to manage the growing codebase efficiently:
   - **Selective Builds**: Pants allows building only the changed code, significantly reducing build times.
   - **Dependency Isolation**: With Pants, we could isolate dependencies per module, avoiding version conflicts and unnecessary bloat.
   - **Optimized Testing**: By testing only impacted modules, Pants helped streamline the CI process, saving time and resources.


#### **Improving Code Quality with Automated Tools**

After the migration, I introduced several automated tools to improve code quality, enforce consistency, and reduce technical debt:
   - **Black**: An automatic code formatter that enforced a unified style across the monolith, making the codebase cleaner and more readable.
   - **Ruff**: A fast, Python linter that ensured our code adhered to best practices, catching potential bugs and enforcing style consistency.
   - **Sourcery**: A tool to detect and remove code smells, simplify logic, and provide intelligent code suggestions, Sourcery helped maintain cleaner and more efficient code.

With these tools, I configured a GitHub workflow for automated linting and formatting, ensuring code quality checks were part of our CI/CD pipeline.


#### **Incrementally Adding Unit Tests**

The lack of unit tests in the initial repos posed a risk to functionality during migration. Here’s how I approached testing:
   - **Module-by-Module Testing**: Before migrating each repository, I added unit tests for its core functions, focusing on critical components first.
   - **Automation**: After migration, unit tests were integrated into the GitHub workflow, enabling automated testing for each pull request.
   - **Code Coverage Tracking**: I set up code coverage tracking to measure test completeness and ensure no gaps.

With these steps, we ensured the monolithic repo was more reliable and resilient.


#### **Results and Key Takeaways**

The transition to a monolith not only streamlined our development process but also brought improvements in code quality. Here are the key takeaways:
   - **Improved Collaboration**: A single repository reduced the complexity of collaborating across projects.
   - **Enhanced Code Quality**: Automated tools like Black, Ruff, and Sourcery maintained consistent, high-quality code.
   - **Reduced Redundancy**: Consolidating duplicated code reduced technical debt and improved maintainability.
   - **Optimized Build and Testing**: With Pants, our CI/CD process became more efficient, reducing time spent on builds and tests.



Migrating to a monolithic repository is more than a simple structural change. It’s an opportunity to improve processes, enhance collaboration, and set up a robust framework for sustainable growth. By combining Polylith’s modular approach, Pants build, and automated quality tools, I transformed our codebase into a maintainable monolith. This journey required a lot of changes, but the results were well worth the effort.
