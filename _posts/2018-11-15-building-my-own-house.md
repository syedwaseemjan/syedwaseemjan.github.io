After working as a software engineer for multiple years, doing part time jobs and spending my money frugally, I had enough savings by the start of 2016 and started building my own house which is almost complete now after nearly two years of construction and I will be moving there soon.

Currently, I am living with my parents and siblings, 6 people in total, in a small 1200 sqft house. The place around our current house has become commercial, yes it can happen in Pakistan. There are no strict rules and regulations in most of the cities and residential places can be used for commercial purpose by making shops and plazas there. So this place has become too crowdy for us, every time we have to leave or get back home, we have to pass through streets jam packed with motorbikes. Moreover, there are electricity blackout problems in this area. Blackout problems are everywhere in Pakistan but in some places, it is worse and ours is among the worse areas.

We could also just had buy a house instead of constructing it but the place I bought land in was a relatively new Gated society with not many houses available for sale. I bought 2700 sqft of land there. Some of the reasons for buying land in that particular place were

- It is a peaceful place away from the hustle-bustle of the city center.
- Everything is planned like streets, parks, shops/market, etc. There is a structure in place for everything. 
- This new place is safe, with a boundary wall, gates, cameras, and Guards, people having no business cannot enter.


I wanted to save money so instead of hiring someone for my floor plans, I worked on it myself. Also, this place doesn't have many restrictions regarding the floor, electrical, or plumber plans and it is not necessary to hire a professional for it. If they detect a problem, they will highlight it and approve it once the issue is fixed. So, I downloaded the [home designer](https://www.homedesignersoftware.com/homedesign/) software and started designing things myself with some help from a friend who also had constructed his own house. The floor plan took a huge time of 6 months which I never anticipated. Reasons
1. Because of learning different things about walls, windows, doors, washrooms, etc.
2. Whenever I came up with my plan and showed it to the family there was always someone who disagreed and didn't like something about it and I had to come up with something so that to take their objections into account though not possible every time. At the time I got frustrated with it but now I feel their criticism helped me improve my design. Floor plans are very important for a beautiful and liveable house and it's very difficult and expensive to change things after a certain stage during construction, so make sure you spent enough time on it and you really like it.

Floor plan for my house.

So finally after finishing and approving our floor, electrical, and plumbing plan, I contacted different contractors for a quote for gray structure and finally hired the one who actually built our current house too.

Construction started with the installations of electricity meter and water bore and pump and our gray structure got completed in 6 months.

Once the gray structure got completed, I hired different contractors for tiles, ceilings, windows, doors and paint and that's how it looked when these things got finished.

A few things I wish I had done differently are
1. I should have installed electrical pipes inside walls for the future installation of Solar panels. Things will look a little ugly and messy when I install solar panels in the future because of all the wires and stuff. 
2. Staircase should have been more wide. I realized it only when we were moving some furniture upstairs.

In the end, I built a nice house and never really expected it will come out so cool, especially the front elevation as I never designed it as the 3D design needed learning some additional skills and I didn't have time for it. We are planning to move there soon and I will be living there for years to come.
