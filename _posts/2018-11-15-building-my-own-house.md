Having my own house was always my dream. After working as a software engineer for several years, engaging in part-time jobs, and managing my finances frugally, I had enough savings by the start of 2016 to begin building my own house, which is now almost complete after nearly two years of construction. I will be moving there soon.

Currently, I am living with my parents and siblings, totaling six people, in a small 1200 sqft house. The area around our current house has become commercial; yes, it can happen in Pakistan. There are no strict rules and regulations in most cities, and residential areas can be converted for commercial purposes by constructing shops and plazas. So, this place has become too crowded for us; every time we leave or get back home, we have to navigate through streets jam-packed with motorbikes. Moreover, there are electricity blackout problems in this area. While blackout problems are widespread in Pakistan, in some places, it is worse, and ours is among the worst areas.

We could have just bought a house instead of constructing one, but the place where I bought land was a relatively new gated society with not many houses available for sale. I purchased 2700 sqft of land there. Some reasons for buying land in that particular place were:

1. It is a peaceful place away from the hustle-bustle of the city center.
2. Everything is planned, including streets, parks, shops/markets, etc. There is a structure in place for everything. 
3. This new place is safe, with a boundary wall, gates, cameras, and guards; people with no business cannot enter.

I wanted to save money, so instead of hiring someone for my floor plan, I worked on it myself. Also, this place doesn’t have many restrictions regarding the floor, electrical, or plumbing plans, and it is not necessary to hire a professional for it. If they detect a problem, they will highlight it and approve it once the issue is fixed. So, I downloaded [home design](https://www.homedesignersoftware.com/homedesign/) software and started designing things myself with some help from a friend who also had constructed his own house. The floor plan took a huge amount of time—6 months, which I never anticipated. Reasons:

1. Learning different things about walls, windows, doors, washrooms, etc.
2. Whenever I came up with my plan and showed it to my family, there was always someone who disagreed and didn’t like something about it. I had to come up with something to take their objections into account, though not possible every time. At the time, I got frustrated with it, but now I feel their criticism helped me improve my design.

Floor plans are very important for a beautiful and livable house, and it’s very difficult and expensive to change things after a certain stage during construction, so make sure you spend enough time on it and really like it.

After completing and approving our floor, electrical, and plumbing plans, I contacted various contractors to obtain quotes for the gray structure. Eventually, I hired the contractor who had built our current house.

Construction commenced with the installation of the electricity meter, water bore, and pump. Our gray structure was completed within six months.

After the completion of the gray structure, I hired various contractors for tiles, ceilings, windows, doors, and paint. This is how it looked once these aspects were finished.

A few things I wish I had done differently are:

1. I should have installed electrical pipes inside the walls for the future installation of solar panels. The future installation might look a bit messy due to wires and other elements.
2. The staircase should have been wider. I only realized this when we were moving some furniture upstairs.

Despite these few small issues, I feel it's a nice house. I never really expected it to turn out so well, especially the front elevation. I didn't design it in 3D because it required acquiring additional skills, and I didn't have the time for it.

My father built his house only after retiring from service, and I have always been told that constructing a house can take a considerable amount of time. Building my house relatively early in my career feels like a significant accomplishment for me. We are planning to move there soon, and I anticipate living there for many years to come.
