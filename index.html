        Waseem Jan is Full Stack Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.britecore.com" target="blank">BriteCore</a>. Previously Waseem co-founded Chef Galaxy (Social marketplace for the dishes and culinary services). Though Chef Galaxy couldn't get successful but as a sole engineer in his team, it gave him tremendous exposure to the whole life cycle of the project right from the first line of the code to the final production deployment. As the budget was tight, he did everything on his own without any DBA, DevOPs, Testing or UI guys.
